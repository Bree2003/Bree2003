Here are some ideas to get you started: -->

- ðŸ”­ Iâ€™m currently working on a startup where we work on our own or client projects to support trainees who are entering the job market, so they can polish their communication and leadership skills, all while gaining experience.
- ðŸŒ± Iâ€™m currently learning layout in figma, business canvas model and application development with flutter.
- ðŸ‘¯ Iâ€™m looking to collaborate on creative projects which are of importance to people, either to the users or the creator themselves.
- ðŸ¤” Iâ€™m looking for help with entrepreneurship, project development, public speaking and leadership.
